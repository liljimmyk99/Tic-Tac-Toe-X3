# Tic-Tac-Toe X3

# Purpose
As I transition out of school work and school projects, I wanted to do a project that would be a good "beginner project with zero help from anyone".  There are many videos about creating tic-tac-toe but I wanted to do this on my own and add my own flare to it.  Thus is why there are 3 different versions of the game.  I made a CLI in GO, vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, and LitElement Web component versions of this game.  This would provide a good refresh of the syntax in all 3 as I took the summer off to work a non-technical job.

# Vision
As I step back into my programmer hat at my full-time job, I want to rename classic games you'd play by hand or at an arcade and build a platform to play them all.  This is meant to be a portfolio project which will eventually be apart of my own website one day.
